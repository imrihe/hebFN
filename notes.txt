processes:
---authentication:
        --GET/login - from routes/index->auth renders login view
        --POST/login - uses 'serialize user'
---add lu-frame association
---add sentence to lu
        --add sentence to sentences' collection

                --search for sentences and choose one to add
        --add sentence to lu and lu to sentence



#### add sentence to LU: ###
GET - form
1. checkbox - 'manual' or 'search'
1.1 if 'manual'
    1.1.1 enter sentence
    1.1.2 send to dependency parser and to meni's service.
    1.1.3 format the sentence according to alon's format+dep_rel and lemma.
1.2 else -'search'
    1.2.1 fill search form (pop-up) (search by lemma\base\word\pos, search content, number of wanted results, diversity, corpus(db)).
    1.2.2 send the form to the search engine (GET)
    1.2.3 for each result - check if already in DB (linearize and search text in mongoDB - sentences collection)
1.3 present the results results - for each result mark:
    1.3.1 add to LU?
    1.3.2 mark segmentation as wrong (will remove the option to add to the LU)
        1.3.2.1 FUTURE: open window in order to correct the segmentation.
    1.3.3 add note -if the sentence is already in the DB (if marked as bad segmentation - hide it)
1.4 "add sentences" - create POST to the server and save all the wanted sentences to the LU.
    (the 'bad segmentation' sentences will also be sent to the server and saved in 'bas sentences' collection)


POST: (format: body.sentences<sentence>=list of sentences, luid, frameid, user.username, sentence={conll31, badSegmentation?, addTOLU?, inDB, db})
1. for each sentence:
    1.1 if in DB
        1.1.1 if badSegmentation - remove from DB or move from sentence to badSentences
        1.1.2 else if addToLu:
            1.1.2.1 add LU to sentence[lus]
            1.1.2.2 add sentence-lu pair to lu-sentence collection

    1.2 else
        1.2.1 if badSegmentation - add to 'badSentences'
        1.2.2 else:
            1.2.2.1 add to 'sentences' and mark segmentation as valid
            1.2.2.2 add LU to sentence[lus]
            1.2.2.3 add sentence-lu pair to lu-sentence collection
2. send result: list of {luid,frameid,sentenceid} pairs.

#add sentence to LU: (luid, sentenceid, frameid):
1. check if sentence is already related to the lu -return "already connected" if it is
2. add the LU id to the sentence lus list
3. add the snetenceid,luid,frameid to the sentence-lu collection.

#add annotation of sentence to lu:
1. load the frame data.
2. load the sentence data.
3. receive annotation+lu+frame+sentence data.
4. add the annotation to the sentence in the lu-sentence collection.
5. add the annotation id to the frame.lu.annotations list.
